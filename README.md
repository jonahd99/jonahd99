Hi, I'm @jonahd99 and I am currently undertaking a PhD in Statistics at Loughborugh Univesity. 
I really enjoy sport, statistics and coding. I currently use R/Rstudio the most but I am starting 
to branch out into C++ and hopefully python.

I graduated from Loughborough University with a First Class Degree in Mathematics and Statistics.
Within my final year at University I undertook a project which I wanted to focus on two things I 
like, sport and statistics. I chose to implement statistical models that are able to make predictions
about the final results of football matches. Once I had implemented these models I chose to pair the best 
performing model with a simple betting strategy to see whether I could, hypothetically, make a profit 
against the bookies! Please see the repository 'final_year_project_undergraduate'. Feel free to ask me any
questions about this.

Currently, in my PhD I am focusing on using statistical methods to model performance in endurance sports such 
as cycling or running.

Thanks for reading this.

Cheers,
Jonah.
